Your UploadThing integration has been successfully configured! Here's what has been set up and what you need to do next.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Configured

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- `uploadthing` - Core UploadThing library
- `@uploadthing/react` - React components for UploadThing

### 2. Files Updated/Created
- `src/lib/uploadthing-client.ts` - Main upload function with UploadThing integration
- `src/api/uploadthing.ts` - UploadThing router configuration
- `src/lib/uploadthing.ts` - Router type definitions
- `src/app/api/uploadthing/route.ts` - API route (placeholder)

### 3. Features Implemented
- ‚úÖ Direct UploadThing API integration
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to base64 if UploadThing fails
- ‚úÖ File validation (image types, 4MB limit)
- ‚úÖ Error handling and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Existing ImageUpload component works with UploadThing

## üöÄ Next Steps - Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create UploadThing Account
1. Go to [uploadthing.com](https://uploadthing.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Get your API keys from the dashboard

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# UploadThing Configuration
VITE_UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
VITE_UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your_app_id_here

# Keep your existing Supabase config
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://omkxduypxjpfwiwxsbrf.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im9ta3hkdXlweGpwZndpd3hzYnJmIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgxNzQ3OTksImV4cCI6MjA3Mzc1MDc5OX0.2nTdy8VlM-W4J12VQ7cqcyLK-mGqaFni9V9bfTfCirI
```

### Step 3: Test the Integration
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/admin` and click "Add Product"
3. Try uploading an image
4. Check the browser console for upload logs

## üîß How It Works

### Upload Flow
1. **User selects image** ‚Üí ImageUpload component
2. **File validation** ‚Üí Type and size checks
3. **UploadThing API** ‚Üí Direct upload to UploadThing CDN
4. **Fallback** ‚Üí Base64 encoding if UploadThing fails
5. **URL returned** ‚Üí Stored in product data

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Primary**: UploadThing CDN (when configured)
- ‚úÖ **Fallback**: Base64 encoding (always available)
- ‚ùå **Previous**: Supabase Storage (replaced)

## üéØ Benefits of UploadThing

- **Fast CDN delivery** - Images load quickly worldwide
- **Automatic optimization** - Images are optimized automatically
- **Easy setup** - Just add API keys
- **Reliable** - Built for production use
- **Cost-effective** - Generous free tier

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you see "UploadThing credentials not configured"
- Make sure you've created the `.env.local` file
- Verify the environment variable names are correct
- Restart your development server after adding env vars

### If uploads fail
- Check your UploadThing dashboard for any errors
- Verify your API keys are correct
- The system will automatically fall back to base64

### If images don't display
- Check the returned URL in the browser console
- Verify the URL is accessible
- Check your network tab for any failed requests

## üìù Production Deployment

When deploying to production:
1. Add the same environment variables to your hosting platform
2. Make sure `VITE_UPLOADTHING_SECRET` and `VITE_UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` are set
3. Test the upload functionality in production

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your image upload system is now configured with UploadThing! The existing ImageUpload component will automatically use UploadThing once you add your API credentials.

**Next**: Add your UploadThing API keys to complete the setup.
